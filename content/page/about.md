I am historian and coffee lover. I received a Ph.D. in European History from UCLA in 2015.

### Research

My research investigates the familial basis of the early modern capitalism through archival research on two mercantile families from Antwerp at the end of the sixteenth and beginning of the seventeenth century. I am currently working on a manuscript that places concepts such as patriarchy, emotion, exile, and friendship at the heart of the efficacy of long-distance trade networks and the growth of capitalism.

I am also working on a digital history project which maps the correspondence network of Daniel van der Meulen, whose archive contains approximately 6,000 letters sent to him over a period of 20 years.
