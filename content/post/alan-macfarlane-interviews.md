title: "Alan MacFarlane Interviews"
---

It really is amazing what you can find on Youtube. Looking around for some interviews with prominent scholars one day, I chanced upon a series of interviews conducted by [Alan Macfarlane.](http://www.alanmacfarlane.com/) Macfarlane is an English historian and student of Keith Thomas, who has interest in both history and anthropology. He is probably best known for his arguments about the development of individualism in England. Over the last number of years he sat down with many prominent scholars, mostly historians and anthropologists of English origin. There are about 200 interviews, and most of them are between an hour and a half and two hours long. I have only been able to listen to a couple so far, and all have been fascinating. You can find the entire list of interviews [here.](http://www.sms.cam.ac.uk/collection/1092396)
