One of my favorite academic pastimes is sitting at a cafe, drinking some coffee, and getting some work done. I usually avoid going to Starbucks. I have plenty of options of independent cafes right by my house. However, I could not help but agree with [Frank Chimero's reasons for writing at Starbucks.](http://weeklydispatch.tumblr.com/post/17123958109/week-1)

> Starbucks is an ideal writing environment: the seats are comfortable, the sights are not distracting. It is warm. They make money hand over fist, so you don’t feel bad for camping out on one drink. The environment is bland and doesn’t have much character of its own, and that means that there is not much to pull me away from the work in front of me. I can focus on the words, because the rest of the environment is vignetted in a fuzziness produced by its lack of opinion on the world.

Here is to the mundane.
