This is going to be a pretty long post, but I think that good use of database applications can be central to better productivity within academics. Databases not only store information, they can make us think about the information we have created or found in different ways. Just as importantly, they can provide easier access to that information so that it does not get lost in the years of research we devote to our projects. There are many different options within this very wide category, but I am only going to list the three programs that I use. I also hope to write more detailed posts about the uses I make of these programs. Specifically, I hope to write more about the various was I use DEVONthink, an application that seems almost endlessly malleable.

The three programs found in this post are DEVONthink Pro, Bento, and MacFamily Tree.

### [DEVONthink Pro](http://www.devontechnologies.com/products/devonthink/overview.html) $79.95, [Academic price](http://www.devontechnologies.com/discounts/students-and-educators.html)  $59.96
If there is one program that is at the center of all of the ways that I have changed how I take notes and think about taking notes it is probably DEVONthink. DEVONthink is a pretty amazing and also pretty complicated program. It is one of those applications where the more time and effort you put into the more you can get out. I use DEVONthink to create a database for all of my research, collecting of all my notes on both primary and secondary literature, as well as the pdfs of the journal articles I have downloaded.

Let me very quickly explain a few of the possibilities. Once all of your notes/pdfs are in the database there are many things you can do.[^f1] The simplest is doing a word search. If I search the term "money" in my database it will show me all of the different places this is found in my notes and pdfs. You can do something similar in Spotlight, but in DEVONthink you view the file right in the program. You can quickly go through and determine how often and where the term is used, make changes to your notes, and add annotations to your pdfs.

You can view your database in various ways in DEVONthink, but probably the most popular, and the one I use is the three-pane view. This places the folder structure and tags on the left of the screen. To the right and above is the files within the selected folder, and below this is the view of the selected file. This viewing pane can show anything from an internet browser, if you are viewing a link, a pdf viewer, or a built in text editor. You can read pdfs and take notes all within the program. In this way, DEVONthink is very similar to [Evernote](http://evernote.com/).

I have recently begun to use the text editor more, as it allows me to quickly switch between different files. I can check information on one document and then move to make a change on another, all within the same window.[^f2] With the use of both a folder system and tags I can keep the folder system of my notes in tact, but use tags to collect all my notes for a paper in one place. This is a feature I used extensively when writing my last paper. I could quickly look at multiple documents without having to search for them or be forced to open multiple windows at the same time.

My favorite advanced feature is Concordance.[^f3] This creates a list of all of the words used in your database and how often they are used. This may sound somewhat simplistic, but there are many different creative uses you can make of this. One problem that I have in writing my notes on primary sources is the various spellings for one term. For example, the "friend" may be spelled in various ways. By ordering the list of words alphabetically, I can quickly group together all of the various spellings and see where all of the uses are. Another use for this is the well known inconsistency for the spelling of proper names in the early modern world.

If you purchase the Pro edition, you can have multiple databases. In addition to the more scholarly database for my research, I have one devoted to things I found on the internet. With the use of the Bookmarklet you can easily save links, pdfs, or the text of a webpage. I save all sorts of information here. Through all of these uses, DEVONthink is a program that I use almost daily. If you are trying to find a way to organize notes that you have taken on your computer I highly recommend downloading a trial version [here](http://www.devontechnologies.com/download/products.html).

### [Bento](http://www.filemaker.com/products/bento/) $29 
Bento is the less complex, little brother of Filemaker. I started using Bento because I was tired of and never properly learned how to use Excel. I wanted to do something simple such as place the dates letters were sent and received from and to various people. The first obstacle in Excel is that the date setting does not accept dates before 1900. All of the letters that form the vast majority of the sources I work on are from the 16th century. This problem could have been overcome by putting in the dates backwards (year/month/date) such as 1592/08/07. However, this small issue signaled to me that Excel was probably not the best tool for this. My other, and larger, frustration with Excel was the search function. Excel search words by going one by one through all of the matching terms. If there are one hundred matching terms in a list of one thousand entries this quickly becomes problematic to the point of being useless. Bento obviates these problems. It allows earlier dates to be put in (it simply converts them to the year/month/date form). And more importantly it searches in the same fashion as something like iTunes. Putting in a search term, only the matches remain present on the screen.

The above shows Bento to be a more capable spread-sheet application for the uses I need. However, Bento also possesses a form view in which only one entry is viewed at a time. You can organize the data in whatever fashion you choose on this page. This allows an easier way to view something like longer notes, a pdf, or even media like a video. All of this expands the functions of the spread-sheet.

### [MacFamily Tree](http://www.syniumsoftware.com/macfamilytree/) $59.99
Lastly, I want to mention the genealogical program that I use. My research is on mercantile families in the 16th century. One of the basic bits of information that I must keep track of is the various ways in which the individuals I deal with are related. Just the thought of keeping track of all of this without the use of a computer makes me shudder. MacFamily Tree does all of the hard work for me. I have over 600 related individuals in my database. It was a bit of a laborious task to input all of this data, and MacFamily Tree is not the most intuitive of programs, but now that I have this done I can quickly and easily see the relationships between individuals or when individuals were born, married, or died.

This software is produced for popular consumption, and so many of the features are geared toward amateur genealogists, and the creation of presentations. There is a lot of wiz bang features that are more designed for eye-candy than function. One of my biggest complaints in the poor export options for creating simple informative family trees. The program is instead designed around the idea of placing pictures and media to go along with family tree, something not overly useful when all of your individuals died before 1650. Despite this, the various family tree views, including a 3-D view of the entire database, have helped me in keeping track of the complicated way in which the people I study are all related.

If any readers use these programs or use other database programs I would love to hear about your uses.


[^f1]: You can either have DEVONthink store all of your notes, or if you want to have your notes in another folder it can index those folders. I chose the latter, simply because I had created a folder system that I was happy with in Finder.

[^f2]: This feature is one reason that I prefer to write my notes in plain text. I can use multiple different text editors, [like all those I listed in the first installment of this series](http://thetextpistols.wordpress.com/2011/11/24/apps-for-academics-1-text-editors/), and not have to worry about messing up any formatting. I make a change in one program, and when I open it up in another it appears with no problems.

[^f3]: This feature does not come with DEVONthink Personal. It only comes with the Pro edition. This is why I recommend going for DEVONthink Pro. If you want to add OCR capabilities for pdfs (something I have been mulling over) then you can spring for the more expensive DEVONthink Pro Office.
