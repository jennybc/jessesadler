title: "University Presidents and Chancellors"
---

About a month ago KPCC had a [roundtable discussion on higher education](http://www.scpr.org/programs/airtalk/2012/01/12/22092/education-forum) moderated by Larry Mantle and involving Chancellor Gene Block (UCLA), President C. Max Nikias (USC), Chancellor Jack Scott (California Community Colleges), and President Laura Skandera Trombley (Pitzer). This was a really interesting, though also somewhat maddening, forum for anyone in academia. It not only showed the type of answers and thoughts the chancellors of the these schools give in such a public forum, it also demonstrated some of the views held by the public toward academia.

I want to mention a few points they touched upon, and give some criticisms of both the questions asked and the answers given. I will especially concentrate on what I believe to be the mistaken assumptions Larry Mantle has about higher education and where the chancellors and presidents pandered to the public instead of having a serious discussion. The podcast is definitely worth a listen, and maybe others will have a less harsh reaction. It can be found [here](http://www.scpr.org/programs/airtalk/2012/01/12/22092/education-forum)

## Rising Cost of Tuition
In general, the chancellors and presidents avoided talking about the rising cost of tuition. President Trombley of Pitzer was especially guilty of this. Both she and President Nikias of USC spoke of financial aid at their schools, but this hardly obviates the fact of the $55,000 price tag of tuition at their schools.

### Professors the Cause of Tuition Hikes?
An odd turn in the discussion comes when Larry Mantle seems to find the cause for the rising tuition in higher salaries for professors. Factually an utterly ridiculous statement, this thinking demonstrates an almost complete lack of understanding of higher education. What it unfortunately leads to is placing the blame of rising costs on the general activity of research.

### Research to get Higher College Ranking
This discussion comes in the context of Mantle speaking of the recent rise of USC in the college ranking publications. Mantle asks if the drive by UCS over the last decade or so to get the best professors, necessitating higher salaries, is about providing the best teaching or if it is rather about getting the best researchers. This is a valid question, but Mantle loses the plot when he equates attracting better research as simply an attempt to move up in college ranking. Though with the recent [scandal at Claremont McKenna](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/31/education/claremont-mckenna-college-says-it-exaggerated-sat-figures.html) maybe I am the naive one. The ideal of a research university is that there is value to having the best students learn from the best researchers who are on the cutting edge of the fields they are teaching. One could argue against this pedagogical paradigm, but Mantle simply ignores it. He seems to give absolutely no value to research in terms of the worth it may bring to society, believing the role of universities to be only about teaching.

## High-tech Lectures
Mantle also challenges the forum on the pedagogical worth of lecturing. Again, this demonstrates questions and criticisms in the general public that academia needs to be aware of. Mantle asks if lecturing still goes on in the old-fashioned manner, suggesting that lecturing to today's students is hardly optimal. The answers that Chancellor Block and President Nikias offer to this are almost completely defensive. They speak of the paradigm shifting away from lecturing, and the use of technology in the classroom. This, of course, is bull shit. Powerpoint is not technology and most lectures are done just they way they always have. One needs to either defend lecturing or change it. To act like it is already actively changing is just false. Equating a rise in technology with a rise in student learning is a much too oft repeated fallacy.

### One Lecture for All
Behind Mantle's criticism of lecturing is a naive understanding of online education. Mantle believes technology can do away with the need to have lectures. The money saved could lead to more seminars. This (mis)understanding is based upon a misunderstanding of lower division classes in particular and liberal arts education in general, not to mention some fuzzy math. Mantle asserts that something like Classics could be lectured about online, assuming that these classes just teach facts, a description that actually fits lower division science classes much better. If lectures are just facts, and the goal is to be cost effective, one wonders if we should not just have one lecturer on each topic. One specialist in each category like Colonial American History can produce a series of lectures that will then be broadcasted to all colleges and universities.

## Liberal Arts Education is Bad Capitalism
Finally, it will not be a surprise that Mantle brings up the trope that while education in science has obvious meaning and utility, liberal arts education is merely for "broadening one's mind" and has no economic worth. This again ignores a defining pedagogical theory in American higher education. American liberal arts education is about improving critical thinking through a broad education. As President Trombley points out universities in America are not pre-vocational or vocational. This is actually much more the case in Europe, where one's course of study is much more defined by one's major. Both Chancellor Block and President Nikias defend the importance of a broad education and the importance of not over specializing. They also point to the economic reasons for such an education. Most individuals will change careers multiple times in the course of their lives, and that what recruiters want in college graduates is individuals with broad critical thinking and analytical skills.

These criticisms of research and liberal arts education are something that academics are going to have to deal with as funding for higher education declines. We need to be able to have serious discussions about these issues. I was a bit disappointed that both sides in this forum were largely unable to move the discussion forward, but maybe this merely shows the depth of divide.
