I spend a lot of my time in cafes with a latte and my computer. This is one of the perks of being a graduate student. No set schedule. No set place that one must be. As long as i get work done, it does not matter whether I am in my office at school, home, or out at a cafe. Sitting at a cafe, I can be out in public, but still have the privacy to sit quietly and get some work done. An enviornment that a recent study argued could [increase creativity.](http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2012/06/study-of-the-day-why-crowded-coffee-shops-fire-up-your-creativity/258742/)

> Compared to a relatively quiet environment (50 decibels), a moderate level of ambient noise (70 dB) enhanced subjects' performance on the creativity tasks, while a high level of noise (85 dB) hurt it. Modest background noise, the scientists explain, creates enough of a distraction to encourage people to think more imaginatively.

Despite the amount of time that I spend in cafes, I am not really all that serious of a coffee drinker. I do not drink coffee for caffeination purposes. In fact, my fear is not that I will be under-caffeinated but that I will get over-caffeinated and not be able to concentrate. I tend to think of coffee as more a ticket to get to sit and work in a cafe for hours at a time.

Espresso drinks are my beverage of choice. Usually just a latte or cappuccino, depending upon the quality of the coffee. I am not a pour over man like Matt. I do enjoy the experience of drinking coffee, but for me, environment often wins out over the quality of the beverage. I would never claim to have a sophisticated palette. I never can taste the mango or distinguish between stone fruit notes in a cup of coffee.

My palette may be limited, but I still enjoy going to more artisanal cafes, so-called [third-wave cafes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Wave_Coffee), and just hanging out. In LA, and even just within Pasadena, there are a lot of great places to choose from. LA Weekly put together a list of [10 Best Coffee Shops in Los Angeles](http://blogs.laweekly.com/squidink/2011/12/the_top_10_coffee_shops_in_los.php), while [Eater LA](http://la.eater.com/) has their own list of [Los Angeles' Best Coffee Shops](http://la.eater.com/archives/2012/03/15/a_guide_to_los_angeles_best_coffee_shops.php). There are some worthy places that are missing, such as [Profeta](http://www.espressoprofetala.com/) in Westwood, but it is a good start. Rell and I have a goal this summer of working through these lists, though we are not off to a very quick start.

Our favorite place right now is [Proof Bakery](http://proofbakeryla.com/) in Atwater Village, which serves [Cognoscenti coffee](http://www.popupcoffee.com/). If you know Proof and Cog coffee, then you should definitely check out [this article on the Smithsonian website](http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/design/2012/07/an-architect-turned-barista-draws-a-fine-line-between-brewing-and-design/) about the founder of Cog coffee and his work as an architect. The article is part of a whole series on coffee and architecture.

I hope to continue to write more about cafes and coffee in LA in the future, documenting some of the places I like and writing about the overall experience.
