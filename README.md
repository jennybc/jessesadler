This is the contents for my personal site that is made using the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) static site generator. The site contains a blog about history and digital humanities and an introduction to some of the digital history projects that I am working on. It also contains descriptions of courses that I have taught at UCLA.

The website itself was a project that forced me to learn more about HTML, CSS, git, and the command line. The blog will further discuss learning about data analysis and GIS with [R](https://www.r-project.org) in order to complete a digital humanities project on the correspondence of Daniel van der Meulen, and early modern merchant from Antwerp.

The website adapts the [Beautiful Hugo theme](http://themes.gohugo.io/beautifulhugo/). Updates are pushed to GitHub and then the site is deployed with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com).
